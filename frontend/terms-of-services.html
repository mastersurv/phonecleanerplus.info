        </p>
        <p>You agree, and represent and warrant, that your use of the Service, or any portion thereof, will be consistent with the foregoing license, covenants and restrictions and will neither infringe nor violate the rights of any other party or breach any contract or legal duty to any other parties.

        </p>
        <h2>4. APP STORES, THIRD PARTY ADS, OTHER USERS</h2>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the App is dependent on the third party from which you received the App, e.g., the Apple App Store, and/or other app stores (collectively, "App Stores" and each, an "App Store").</p>
        <p>
          You agree to pay all fees charged by the App Stores in connection with the App. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the App is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable agreements, terms of use/service, and other policies of the App Stores. You acknowledge that the App Stores (and their subsidiaries) are a third party beneficiary of these Terms and will have the right to enforce these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>The Service may contain links to third party websites or resources and advertisements for third parties (collectively, "Third Party Ads"). Such Third Party Ads are not under the control of the FZCO and the FZCO is not responsible for any Third Party Ads. The FZCO provides these Third Party Ads only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third Party Ads. Advertisements and other information provided by Third Party Sites Ads may not be wholly accurate. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources. When you link to a third party site, the applicable service provider's terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices govern. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party. Your transactions and other dealings with Third Party Ads that are found on or through the App, including payment and delivery of related goods or services, are solely between you and such merchant or advertiser.</p>
        <p>Each user of the Service is solely responsible for any and all his or her User Content.

        <h2>5. SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND PAYMENT</h2>
        <p>
          Certain features of the Service may be offered on a subscription basis for a fee. You may purchase a subscription directly from the FZCO or <a href="http://security-app.pro">http://security-app.pro</a> or through an App Store either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) prepayment giving you access to the Service for a specific time period (together or separately “Purchase”).
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change Purchase fees at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the App and/or by sending you an email notification, or in other prominent ways. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you can cancel the applicable subscription prior to the change going into effect or/and abstain from pre-paying for access to the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          You authorize us and the App Stores to charge the applicable fees to the payment card that you submit.
          By signing up for certain subscriptions, you agree that your subscription may be automatically renewed. Unless you cancel your subscription you authorize us and the App Stores to charge you for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal will be the same as your initial subscription period unless otherwise disclosed to you on the Service. The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your auto-renewal. You must cancel your subscription in accordance with the cancellation procedures disclosed to you for the particular subscription. We will not refund fees that may have accrued to your account and will not prorate fees for a canceled subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may offer a trial subscription for the Service. Trial provides you access to the Service for a period of time, with details specified when you sign up for the offer. Unless you cancel before the end of the free trial, or unless otherwise stated, your access to the Service will automatically continue and you will be billed the applicable fees for the Service. It is ultimately your responsibility to know when the free trial will end. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to modify or terminate any free trial offer, your access to the Service during the free trial, or any of these terms without notice and with no liability. We reserve the right to limit your ability to take advantage of multiple free trials.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service and your rights to use it expire at the end of the paid period of your subscription. If you do not pay the fees or charges due, we may make reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate your access to the Service (and may do so without notice).
          Subscriptions purchased via an App Store are subject to such App Store's refund policies. This means we cannot grant refunds. You will have to contact App Store support.
        </p>
        <p>You agree that the Purchase is final, that FZCO will not refund any transaction once it has been made and that the Purchase cannot be canceled. When you make the Purchase, you acknowledge and agree that all Purchases are non-refundable or exchangeable. Since the Service is of a digital nature, we cannot accept any request for refunds and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point. The FZCO may provide refunds at its own discretion and subject to our policies that may be published from time to time.</p>
        <p>We may post clear and conspicuous subscription terms from time to time on our websites and within the Apps.</p>

          (d) The arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mandatory Arbitration
        </p>
        <p>
          This arbitration agreement provides that all disputes must be resolved through BINDING ARBITRATION whenever you or we choose to submit or refer a dispute to arbitration. You and the FZCO, and each of our respective agents, corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, agree to BINDING ARBITRATION (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court), as the exclusive form of dispute resolution except as provided for below, for all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Privacy Policy) or the Service, unless you are located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute resolution. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Waiver of Class Action and Collective Relief
        </p>
        <p>
          There shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or litigated on a class action, joint or consolidated basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users of the Services, or any other persons. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that individual party’s claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. This waiver of class actions and collective relief is an essential part of this arbitration provision and cannot be severed from it.

          Arbitration Procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any questions regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION under the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) Rules in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Overview. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties’ dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings. The following procedures (the “Arbitration Procedures”) are applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving you and us.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. We are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. Therefore, before you commence an arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint, as we may be able to resolve it without the need for arbitration. You may contact us online at the email address indicated in Section 15.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Administrator. The administrator for the arbitration is the LCIA, a non-profit organization that is not affiliated with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Seat of Arbitration. The seat of the arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Choice of Law. The governing law applicable to the arbitration agreement and the arbitration shall be the laws of England and Wales (also known as English Law), without regard to English Law’s conflict of laws rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Language. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Applicable Rules. The arbitration will be governed by the LCIA’s Arbitration Rules (“LCIA Rules”), as modified by these Arbitration Procedures. If there is any inconsistency between the LCIA’s Rules and these Arbitration Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures will control. However, if the arbitrator determines that strict application of the Arbitration Procedures would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration, the arbitrator may make any order necessary to provide a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the LCIA Rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Commencing an Arbitration. To commence an arbitration against us, you must complete a written request for arbitration, submit it to the LCIA, and send a copy to us at the email address indicated in Section 15. To learn more about commencing an arbitration and to obtain a form to institute arbitration, see the LCIA’s online filing page. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or have a lawyer (or some other representative) act on your behalf. Upon receipt of an arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims it may have against the complaining party.
        </p>
        <p>- Fees. You are responsible for paying your portion of the fees set forth in the LCIA’s Schedule of LCIA Arbitration Costs and as determined by the Arbitral Tribunal under LCIA Rules. We will pay all remaining fees. If your claim against us is for less than USD1,000, we will pay all fees. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys’ fees and additional costs. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, we will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay.</p>
        <p>
          - Selection of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be appointed by the LCIA in accordance with its rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Discovery. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged documents from the other party; and (b) request that the other party provide the particulars of its claims or defenses. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other party within 10 days after the arbitrator’s appointment. The responding party shall provide the requesting party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, the requested particulars, and/or any objections to the requests within 15 days after receipt of the requests. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the arbitrator for prompt resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort what would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.
        </p>
        <p>- Communications with the Arbitrator. Whenever communicating with the arbitrator, the parties must include each other – for example, by including the other party on a telephone conference call and copying the other party on any written submissions, such as letters or emails. To the extent practicable, conferences with the arbitrator will take place by telephone conference call or email. Ex parte communications are not permitted with any arbitrator.</p>
        <p>- Confidentiality. Upon either party’s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted filing of confidential information must be done under seal.</p>
        <p>- Arbitration Award. The arbitrator will render a written decision within 14 days after the hearing or, if no hearing was held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award.</p>
        <p>
          - Waiver of Appeal. The parties waive any right to refer any question of law and any right of appeal on the law and/or the merits to any court.
        </p>
        <p>- Survivability. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>
        <h2>12. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms shall be governed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales (excluding its body of law governing conflicts of law).
        </p>
        <p>To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is for whatever reason not submitted to arbitration, each of the parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of England and Wales to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with this Terms and that accordingly proceedings must be brought in such courts.</p>
        <p>The parties irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts of England and waive any defenses of improper venue or forum non conveniens.</p>
        <h2>13. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</h2>
        <p>
          No delay or omission by us in exercising any of our rights occurring upon any noncompliance or default by you with respect to these Terms will impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by the FZCO of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained.
        </p>
        <p>Subject to Section 12, if any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then these Terms will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, these Terms set forth the entire agreement between you and the FZCO regarding its subject matter, and supersede all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.</p>
        <p>The FZCO may transfer or assign any and all of its rights and obligations under these Terms to any other person, by any way, including by novation, and by accepting these Terms you give the FZCO consent to any such assignment and transfer. You confirm that placing on the Service of a version of these Terms indicating another person as a party to the Terms shall constitute valid notice to you of the transfer of FZCO's rights and obligations under the Terms (unless otherwise is expressly indicated).</p>
        <p>All information communicated on the Service is considered an electronic communication. When you communicate with us through or on the Service or via other forms of electronic media, such as e-mail, you are communicating with us electronically. You agree that we may communicate electronically with you and that such communications, as well as notices, disclosures, agreements, and other communications that we provide to you electronically, are equivalent to communications in writing and shall have the same force and effect as if they were in writing and signed by the party sending the communication. You further acknowledge and agree that by clicking on a button labeled "SUBMIT", "CONTINUE", "REGISTER", "I AGREE" or similar links or buttons, you are submitting a legally binding electronic signature and are entering into a legally binding contract. You acknowledge that your electronic submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by these Terms. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS, ORDERS AND OTHER RECORDS AND TO ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED OR COMPLETED THROUGH THE SERVICE.</p>
        <p>In no event shall the FZCO be liable for any failure to comply with these Terms to the extent that such failure arises from factors outside the FZCO's reasonable control.</p>
