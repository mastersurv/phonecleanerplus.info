Consequently, we, in particular, better understand in what of our features and content you see the most value and are able to focus on them to enhance your experience and increase the quality of our products.

        <h3>FOR WHAT PURPOSES WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
        <p>We process your personal data:</p>
        <h4>1. To provide our Service</h4>
        <p>This includes enabling you to use the Service in a seamless manner and preventing or addressing Service errors or technical issues. To host personal data and enable our App to operate and be distributed we use Amazon Web Services, which is a hosting and backend service provided by Amazon. To monitor infrastructure and the App’s performance, we use Crashlytics, which is a monitoring service provided by Google. We use Firebase Performance Monitoring and Firebase Crash Reporting, which are monitoring services provided by Google. To learn more, please visit Google’s Privacy policy and Privacy and Security in Firebase.</p>
        <h4>2. To customize your experience</h4>
        <p>We process your personal data, in particular, such as your characteristics and preferences, to adjust the content of the Service and provide content tailored to your personal preferences. As a result of such processing, you get access, for example, to a nutrition plan containing only vegetarian products or a customized meal plan offer (in the in-App chat) tailored for achieving your goals.</p>
        <h4>3. To manage your account and provide you with customer support</h4>
        <p>
          We process your personal data to respond to your requests for technical support, Service information or to any other communication you initiate. This includes accessing your account to address technical support requests. For this purpose, we may send you, for example, notifications or emails about the performance of our Service, security, payment transactions, notices regarding our <a href="http://security-app.pro/terms-of-services.html">http://security-app.pro/terms-of-services.html</a> or this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h4>4. To communicate with you regarding your use of our Service</h4>
        <p>
          We communicate with you, for example, by push notifications. These may include reminders and motivational messages encouraging you to follow your training and nutrition plan, or other information about the App. As a result, you may, for example, receive a push notification every day at a particular time reminding you to work out. To opt out of receiving push notifications, you need to change the settings on your device.
          The services that we use for these purposes may collect data concerning the date and time when the message was viewed by our App’s users, as well as when they interacted with it, such as by clicking on links included in the message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intercom provides us with message and customer service tools, which enable us to communicate with you within the App. When you chat with us via in-App chat, some of your information is automatically transferred to Intercom. The transfer is required to enable us to identify (if you shared any name related data with us) and to communicate with you in the in-App chat. Thus, Intercom uses these data to provide and fulfill its services (as set forth in their terms of service).
          To communicate with you we also use Firebase Cloud Messaging and Firebase Notifications, which are message sending services provided by Google. Firebase Cloud Messaging allows us to send messages and notifications to users of our App across platforms such as Android and iOS. We integrate Firebase Notifications with Firebase Analytics to create analytics-based audiences and track opening and conversion events. As a result, we can, for example, send encouraging messages to users who have recently finished a training program. Google's privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use Apple Push Notification service (“APNs”), that is a notifications service provided by Apple. APNs allow us to send information to iOS devices. Apple's privacy policy.

          This helps us to better understand our business, analyze our operations, maintain, improve, innovate, plan, design, and develop the Service and our new products. We also use data for statistical analysis purposes, to test and improve our offers. This enables us to better understand what features and training plans of the Services our users like more, what categories of users use our Services. As a consequence, we often decide how to improve the Service based on the results obtained from this processing. For example, if we discover that users more often engage in workouts designated for legs, we may develop and introduce a new workout for this area into the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          To perform research and analysis about how users interact with our App we use Appsflyer. Appsflyer enables us to understand, in particular, how users find us (for example, who was the advertiser that delivered an ad to users, which led you to an app store with our App). Appsflyer also provides us with different analytics tools that enable us to research and analyze your use of the Service. Appsflyer allows you to have data from my device sent to AppsFlyer's servers for apps usage collection.
          We use Facebook Analytics, which is a service provided by Facebook that allows us to use different analytical tools. On Facebook Analytics we get, in particular, aggregated demographics and insights on how many people launch our app, how often users make purchases, and other interactions.

        <p>
          We process your personal data for our marketing campaigns. We may add your email address to our marketing list, provided we receive consent or otherwise establish a legal basis for sending you marketing communications. As a result, you will receive information about our products, such as, for example, special offers.

        <h4>7. To personalize our ads</h4>

For example, if you have installed our App, you might see ads of our products, for example, in your Facebook’s feed. We do not use health, motion, and fitness information gained through Apple Health Kit or Google Fit to personalize our ads.</p>
        <h5>How to opt out or influence personalized advertising</h5>
        <p>
          <b>iOS</b>: On your iPhone or iPad, go to “Settings,” then “Privacy” and tap “Advertising” to select “Limit Ad Track”. In addition, you can reset your advertising identifier (this also may help you to see less of personalized ads) in the same section.

        </p>
        <p>
          We use Facebook Ads Manager together with Facebook Custom Audience, which allows us to choose audiences that will see our ads on Facebook or other Facebook’s products (for example, Instagram). Through Facebook Custom Audience we may create a list of users with certain sets of data, such as an IDFA, choose users that have completed certain actions in the App (for example, installed it). As a result, we may ask Facebook to show some ads to a particular list of users. As a result, more of our ads may show up while you are using Facebook or other Facebook’s products (for example, Instagram). You may learn how to opt out of advertising provided to you through Facebook Custom Audience. Facebook also allows its users to influence the types of ads they see on Facebook. To find how to control the ads you see on Facebook, please go or adjust your ads settings on Facebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Ads is an ad delivery service provided by Google that can deliver ads to users. In particular, Google allows us to tailor the ads in a way that they will appear, for example, only to users that have conducted certain actions with our App (for example, show our ads to users who have purchased a subscription). Some other examples of events that may be used for tailoring ads include, in particular, installing our App, finishing a workout program.
        </p>
        <p>We also use Snapchat Advertising Platform together with Snapchat Audience Based Match, which is an ad delivery service provided by Snapchat that can link the activity of some users of our App with the Snapchat advertising network and show some of our ads to them. As a result, you may see more ads on Snapchat in case you use our App. Snapchat allows you to have their audience based ads.</p>
        <h4>8. To process your payments</h4>
        <p>
          We provide paid products and/or services within the Service. For this purpose, we use third-party services for payment processing (for example, payment processors).
